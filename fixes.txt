# Common
 - Wrong includes (GL.h -> gl.h)
 - switch for strings (wtf?)
 - missed includes 
 - wrong qrc data (lightingFragmentShader.fsh)
 - OBJloader should return new object. Not storing permanent object like vertices data
 - change switch-case to if else in OBJ loader
 - do not name classes with Q prefix
 - do not use struct
 - make different modules reusable by adding them into namespaces and adding .pri files for them
 - test OBJloader
 - polygons array should be flat
# Code/Style
 - Qt code style
 - namespaces
 - Typos (pyramide)
 - methods from low case
 - classes that purely work with GL should contain GL prefix
