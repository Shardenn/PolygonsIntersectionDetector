DONE - model_data.h -> modeldata.h
DONE - asserts or logging instead of close()
- runTests - every run of project
- brackets for ifs
OK - references inside for (for (auto &x : container))
- fix bad pointers
- add triangulated data into MeshData
IN PROGRESS - split vertices, normals and texture vertices from vertex data to separate buffer. Store theim in MeshData
- split (parse and all other) logic into smaller functions. Should be easy to test
